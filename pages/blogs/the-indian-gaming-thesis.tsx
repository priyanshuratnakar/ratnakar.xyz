It&apos;s visually stunning, technically ambitious, and narratively rooted in Indian landscapes. From scanning assets on the ground to crafting immersive worlds, it&apos;s a rare full-stack attempt at a truly Indian game.

                But here&apos;s the thing - it&apos;s not the first time we&apos;ve built something beautiful.

              <Text>
                We had <a href="https://rajithegame.com/" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Raji: An Ancient Epic</a>, a mythology inspired adventure that was nominated for best debut game at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_Awards_2020" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>The Game Awards 2020</a> but lost to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Phasmophobia</a> and this was the first time that an Indian game had been nominated for an award at that show. Studios like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhruva_Interactive" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Dhruva Intractive</a> (acquired by Rockstar), <a href="https://99games.in/" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>99Games</a>, and <a href="https://www.nazara.com/" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Nazara Technologies</a> have existed for years.

                Inspiration from the East

              <Text>
                I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Myth:_Wukong" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Black Myth: Wukong</a> was one of Varun&apos;s inspirations. That game is a love letter to Chinese mythology with next gen graphics and storytelling, built by a Chinese indie studio. If China can mythologize the Journey to the West in <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5" style={{ color: '#005B99'}}>Unreal Engine 5</a>, why can&apos;t India do the same with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Mahabharata</a>?
              </Text>
              <Text>
                The best part? We don&apos;t need to invent fictional worlds. Our myths and epics are rich, layered, and expansive. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramayana" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Ramayan</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Mahabharata</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_Purana"style={{ color: '#005B99'}}>Shiv Puran</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenali_Rama" style={{ color: '#005B99'}}>Tenali Rama</a> theres centuries of content waiting to be visualized in pixels.

                And if we do mix fantasy with fiction? That&apos;s a winning combo. Think of what Marvel did with Norse mythology. Why can&apos;t India build its own gaming multiverse?

                An idea
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Imagine a game called <b>Call of Devta</b> - an epic inspired action RPG where each god is a superhero. Every character has a weapon and power unique to their story:
              </Text>
              <Text>
                • Lord Shiva with his Trishula and his third eye<br />
                • Lord Vishnu with the Sudarshana Chakra<br />
                • Hanuman Ji with his Gada and insane agility
              </Text>
              <Text>
                Pick your Devta. Unlock their power. Defeat Ashuras. Choose your strategies. Form your divine squad. This is not just fan fiction. This could genuinely be a compelling, global IP if done right.

                Japan gave us anime. South Korea gave us K-pop. Why can&apos;t India do the same with games?
              </Text>
              <Text>
                At one point, the US and Japan were enemies. Fast forward to today, and global youth proudly wear <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naruto_(TV_series)" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Naruto merch </a>and worship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Miyazaki</a> films . Culture transcends borders if the medium is strong enough.

                But It Can Backfire
              </Text>
              <Text>
                India is a deeply emotional and politically sensitive country.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                If someone builds a mythology-based game, one small error - a wrong depiction, an over exaggeration, a misunderstood mechanic can lead to political outrage, bans, or worse. Studios could be shut down over an artistic interpretation.
              </Text>
              <Text>
                So the approach here has to be: respect + creativity. Get the historians, the mythologists, the storytellers involved. Build responsibly.

                I grew up pirating games. Burned CDs from nearby shop, cracked versions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Payne" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Max Payne</a>, and torrents of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike" style={{ color: '#005B99' }}>Counter-Strike</a>.

                Streaming made gaming aspirational. The phone became a console. And mobile gaming became a lifestyle. Between 2017–2020. By 2025, we&apos;re projected to have over 650M gamers in India.

                • Earmark a $5–10M gaming seed fund<br />
                • Launch a gaming-first accelerator with global mentors<br />
                • Partner with Unreal, Unity, and YouTube Gaming<br />
                • Back full-stack builders, not just hypercasual devs<br />
                • Push original IPs and long-form development cycles

              <Text>
                And above all: <strong>think long-term</strong>. Building a game is not a 6-month sprint, it&apos;s a 3–5 year journey.

                • <strong>Conviction</strong> : from both founders and investors.<br />
                • <strong>Infrastructure</strong> : cloud, tooling, and education.<br />
                • <strong>Protection</strong> : against premature outrage and cultural bans.<br />
                • <strong>Patience</strong> : because the best games take time.
